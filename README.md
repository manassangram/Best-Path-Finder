# Best-Path-Finder
Analysis of Geospatial Data for Computation of Best Path for Non-Motor Commutation
•	Developing a software application that analyses the 3D Geospatial data using Big Data management and Map-Reducing tools to solve the problems faced by cyclists in choosing the optimal path.
•	Designed and implemented a module dealing with the analysis of path weight based on elevation and the energy spent by cyclists.
